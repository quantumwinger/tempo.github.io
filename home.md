I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Paesani. My research revolves around the methodology development and application of quantum chemical methods, which either makes the traditional electronic structure theory more efficient or gives insights about different physical and chemical properties.
