I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Paesani. My research revolves around the methodology development and application of quantum chemical methods, which either makes the traditional electronic structure theory more efficient or gives insights about different hysical and chemical properties. 

- How do changes in environmental conditions affect the economy, and vice versa? 
- How should societies manage their natural resources when they are faced with uncertainty? 
- Do environmental policies function as intended, or are there unexpected consequences?

While there are important theoretical components to these questions, my work is mostly empirical. I rely on a mix of tools that includes classical econometrics, Bayesian methods, geospatial computation, and newer data science tools like machine learning. 

Alongside my regular research, I spend quite a lot time thinking about how to promote better coding practices among social scientists (including, most of all, myself). I am an advocate for open and reproducible science, as well as open-source software. You can find various materials along these lines on my website.
